# Outline


This project is about the weird and unfair contrast between how much food we waste and how many people still can’t get to basic groceries. Rich countries throw out a shocking amount of food per person every year. At the same time, a lot of people, even in those same countries, live in what’s called food deserts. That means they don’t have easy access to fresh or affordable food.

I want to put those two things side by side. I’ll show how food waste looks on a global scale, and then zoom in on cities and neighborhoods in the U.S. where people struggle to buy fresh food. 

Zoom into the U.S. Show what a food desert actually looks like. Use census tract maps from cities like Detroit, Atlanta, or Chicago. Highlight income levels, store access, race, and transport. Bring in some short facts like health outcomes, hunger stats, kids skipping meals, how much edible food ends up in landfills. Then I’ll bring in a few examples of things that are actually working, like food redistribution programs, local food sharing, and community solutions. 



 

## Initial sketches

I have created these rough sketches using python and some made up data.

# The data



| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
|   Food Waste Per Capita   |   [Link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/food-waste-per-capita)   |      Global dataset showing how much food is wasted per person, country by country.       |
|   USDA Food Access Research Atlas   |   [Link](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/)   |      Detailed map data on food deserts in the U.S. It shows where people lack access to grocery stores.       |
|   EPA's Excess Food Opportunities Map   |   [Link](https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/excess-food-opportunities-map​)   |      Provides data on potential sources of excess food, including information on food waste generation and management facilities. This can be useful for understanding the landscape of food surplus and waste.​       |



# Method and medium


I am planning on using Shorthand to create a visually pleasing presentation and using tableau to create all the data visualisations and charts and graphs.



## AI acknowledgements
Used GPT to search for one of the data sources as I was not able to find any reliable sources with extensive datasets.
