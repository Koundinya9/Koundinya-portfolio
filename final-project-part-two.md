# User research 

## Target audience

The primary target audience for this project is local policy makers and urban planning officials. These are the people in a position to influence how cities approach issues of food access, waste management, and infrastructure investment. By showing how food deserts and food waste coexist, often in the same regions, the story aims to provide these decision-makers with a clearer picture of the systemic inefficiencies and opportunities for intervention. 
While the general public may also engage with the content, and it helps spread awareness that way, the structure and depth of the narrative are meant to directly support policy decisions that can lead to measurable change.


## Interview script


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Make sure the core message of the story is clear and compelling   |         When you saw the beginning of the story, what did you think the main idea was?         |
|   Make sure the "solution" part of the story feels real, not rushed   |        Did the part about solutions or hope feel convincing? Or did it feel rushed or small compared to the problem?          |
|   Understand if the visuals are engaging and easy to follow   |        Which visual made the strongest impression and why? Was there any visual that confused you or felt like it needed more explanation?          |




## Interview findings




| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| When you saw the beginning of the story, what did you think the main idea was? | The main idea of the story was clear, it’s about the contradiction between food waste and food deserts. But the introduction needs to be stronger to draw the viewer in immediately.            | The story was about how some communities struggle to access food even though there’s more than enough being wasted elsewhere. Starting with the food access problem made the story feel more grounded and real.            | The slope chart showing food access improvement was one of the strongest. The world food waste chart didn’t add much, it felt too generic and expected.            |
|            Did the part about solutions or hope feel convincing? Or did it feel rushed or small compared to the problem?              | The message was communicated clearly, the contrast between food being wasted and people going hungry landed well.                               | 	The solution section felt rushed and too general. It needs more specifics, maybe case studies or numbers that show impact, like meals delivered or neighborhoods reached.            | The line graph was a good start, but the solution section overall felt underdeveloped. It needs more context or explanation to feel real.            |
|            Which visual made the strongest impression and why? Was there any visual that confused you or felt like it needed more explanation?             | The key message is a broken system where food is both wasted and inaccessible and it was easy to understand. The framing works well.                               | The solution part felt like an afterthought. It needs more structure, more visual support, and ideally some real data on what’s working.            | The heatmap showing food waste by source and region was clean and effective.            |



# Identified changes for Part III

Based on feedback from both the professor and peer interviews, the main issues identified were that the story started too broadly, the solution section felt rushed, and some visuals needed stronger context or explanation.  In Part III, I’ll be focusing on refining the solution section with stronger data and adding more visual cues to guide the viewer through the story.

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The beginning felt too broad and took too long to get going | I’ve reordered the slides to start with food access at the city level, so the audience connects faster |
|                    The “solution” section felt rushed and less supported by data                      |         I’ll be sourcing real datasets for food rescue and improving that section with stronger visualizations                                                                        |
|                    Some visuals were confusing or didn’t feel fully explained                      |       I have added clearer captions, highlighting key data points directly in the charts, and improving transitions                                                                          |
|                   Feedback to “zoom in” more specifically                       |            I have selected specific cities and will continue refining these sections with real neighborhood data                                                                     |


## Final Thoughts 

This round of feedback helped me realize that my story needs to be more grounded in specifics and visually intuitive. I am now thinking more carefully about who the story is for and how each part builds toward something actionable. 

And for Part 2, I have just focused on the story and the data representations, and I have not finalised the visuals of the story board in shorthand. 


## AI acknowledgements
I have used GPT to search for nice datasets, and also help me with tableau visualisations as I am new to the software and had a bunch of questions along the way.
