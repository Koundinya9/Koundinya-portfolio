# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Make sure the core message of the story is clear and compelling   |         When you saw the beginning of the story, what did you think the main idea was?         |
|   Make sure the "solution" part of the story feels real, not rushed   |        Did the part about solutions or hope feel convincing? Or did it feel rushed or small compared to the problem?          |
|   Understand if the visuals are engaging and easy to follow   |        Which visual made the strongest impression and why? Was there any visual that confused you or felt like it needed more explanation?          |

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| When you saw the beginning of the story, what did you think the main idea was? | The main idea of the story was clear, it’s about the contradiction between food waste and food deserts. But the introduction needs to be stronger to draw the viewer in immediately.            | The global scale feels too broad. The story would be more powerful if it focused on a specific city, especially earlier in the narrative.            | The slope chart showing food access improvement was one of the strongest. The world food waste chart didn’t add much, it felt too generic and expected.            |
|            Did the part about solutions or hope feel convincing? Or did it feel rushed or small compared to the problem?              | The message was communicated clearly, the contrast between food being wasted and people going hungry landed well.                               | 	The solution section felt rushed and too general. It needs more specifics, maybe case studies or numbers that show impact, like meals delivered or neighborhoods reached.            | The line graph was a good start, but the solution section overall felt underdeveloped. It needs more context or explanation to feel real.            |
|            Which visual made the strongest impression and why? Was there any visual that confused you or felt like it needed more explanation?             | The key message is a broken system where food is both wasted and inaccessible and it was easy to understand. The framing works well.                               | The solution part felt like an afterthought. It needs more structure, more visual support, and ideally some real data on what’s working.            | The heatmap showing food waste by source and region was clean and effective.            |
