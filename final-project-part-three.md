# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
Based on the feedback from Part 2, I’ve reordered the slides to start with food access at the city level, so the audience connects faster.
I have also sourced real datasets for food rescue and improving that section with stronger visualizations. I have also added clearer captions, highlighting key data points directly in the charts, and improving transitions. I have selected specific cities and will continue refining these sections with real neighborhood data.


## The audience

The primary audience for this story is policy makers, especially those involved in food security, urban planning, and waste management. The goal is to show how systemic failures create both food waste and food deserts, and why policy interventions are needed to fix access, distribution, and enforcement.

A secondary audience is the general public, particularly people interested in social issues or community-based solutions. For them, the story aims to raise awareness about how serious and connected the problems of food waste and hunger really are — even in places that seem to have plenty.


## Final design decisions

Throughout the project, I tried to design the story in a way that balanced clean visuals with a clear narrative. One major decision was to zoom in from a global view down to specific counties, focusing on Los Angeles and Jacksonville, to make the problem feel more real and tangible, rather than abstract.

For the visualizations, I kept the charts simple and avoided overloading the viewer with too many complex graphs. Instead, I used bar charts, maps, and a line graph to highlight key moments without slowing down the story's flow. I also chose to focus more on comparisons between cities and counties rather than overwhelming national data, to better align with my target audience of policy makers.

Another important design choice was to make the story feel like a journey, starting with food shortage, introducing the contradiction, food waste, explaining the cause, and ending with real solutions and a call to action.

One thing that stood out to me was how important it is to think about pacing, making sure every slide adds something and keeping the viewer engaged without throwing too much at once. Working through this helped me realize that data visualization isn’t just about showing data, it's about shaping how someone experiences the story you’re telling.

# Final thoughts

I think the project came out well. I was able to find a clear story that connected food shortage and food waste. I am happy that the project feels easy to follow and not just like random charts put together. If I had more time, I would have liked to find better city level data, especially for Jacksonville. I also would have liked to spend more time making the visualizations feel even more natural with the story.

The part I liked the most was zooming in step by step. Starting from the world, then the country, then the city, and finally the neighborhoods. It made the problem feel more real.
