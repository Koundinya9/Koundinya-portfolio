# About me
Hi! My name is P. V. Koundinya. I am from Bangalore, India. I did my undergrad in Computer Science, and am currently in the 16 month track of Information Systems Management program with a concentration in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. 




# What I hope to learn
In this course, I want to learn :-

1. How to present data in a clear, and compelling way.
2. Get some hands on experience with tools like Tableau and Power BI
3. Learn the best design practices to make the visualisations look intuitive, aesthetically pleasing and easy to interpret.
4. And most importantly, how to make a really nice online portfolio !

Looking to work in data science or data analysis after graduation.
